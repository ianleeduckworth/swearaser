# Swearaser

Welcome to the Swearaser!  Quick question: have you ever gotten frustrated and named one of your variables something inappropriate only to get your code working, forget about the naughty word, commit your code, and then have to explain to your boss why you named a variable "assCheeks"?  Well, you're definitely not alone, and this extension exists to help you.  Swearaser will constantly check all of your files and it will underline any word that it finds that is inappropriate.  It will not stop you in any way, but it gives you a little indication.
